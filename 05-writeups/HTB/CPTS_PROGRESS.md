## How to Use This Integration

**Daily Workflow:**
1. Check `HTB_JUNIOR_PENTESTER_PROGRESS.md` for today's learning module
2. Complete the module during 7-9 AM study block
3. Check here (`CPTS_PROGRESS.md`) to see if you're ready for the next box difficulty
4. If ready, attempt next-level machine (afternoon/evening lab work)
5. Document box writeup in corresponding difficulty folder (01-EASY/, 02-MEDIUM/, etc.)
6. Update both progress files

**Weekly Sync:**
- Monday: Review learning path progress for the week
- Check if you're unlocking the next machine difficulty level
- Adjust box selection based on what you've learned
- Ensure learning modules are feeding directly into machine selection

**Strategic Checkpoint (Feb 1):**
- Complete HTB Junior Pentester 100% before starting CPTS
- This IS the required foundation; don't skip modules to get to machines faster
- Quality foundation = faster machine completion later

**Week 9:**
