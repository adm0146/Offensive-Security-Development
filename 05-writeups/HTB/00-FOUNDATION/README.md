# HTB Foundation - Writeups & Notes

**Start Date:** January 22, 2026  
**Focus:** Building fundamentals with Easy machines  
**Target:** 2-3 machines/week, 6-8 machines total in foundation phase

---

## Foundation Phase Overview

This folder contains comprehensive writeups from foundational HTB CPTS machines. Each writeup documents:
- Complete exploitation methodology
- Reconnaissance techniques
- Vulnerability identification and exploitation
- Privilege escalation chains
- Professional documentation and proof of concept

**Goal:** Build speed, confidence, and reliable methodology before progressing to Medium difficulty.
