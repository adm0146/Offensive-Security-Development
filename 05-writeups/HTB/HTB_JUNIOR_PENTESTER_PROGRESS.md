## Post-Path Goals (Feb 1+)

Once 100% complete (target Jan 31):
- [ ] Celebrate completion! 🎉
- [ ] Review weak areas (if any)
- [ ] Start CPTS curriculum (Feb 1)
- [ ] Begin CPTS lab work
- [ ] Use Junior Pentester knowledge as foundation

---

## Connection to CPTS

**How This Path Connects:**
- Junior Pentester = Foundation building
- CPTS = Applied mastery (30+ real systems)
- Concepts you learn here = Used in CPTS labs
- Tools introduced = Mastered in CPTS

**Skills Transfer:**
- SQL Injection (Junior) → Complex SQLi chains (CPTS)
- XSS basics (Junior) → Chained with other attacks (CPTS)
- Reconnaissance (Junior) → Deep enumeration (CPTS)
- Command injection (Junior) → RCE + escalation (CPTS)

---

## Contact & Questions

- Review HTB Academy explanations if stuck
- Check reference section of README.md for quick lookups
- Don't memorize - understand the concepts
- Ask yourself "why does this work?" for each technique
