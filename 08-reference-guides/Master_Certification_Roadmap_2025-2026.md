**Academic Workload Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Spring 2026 semester may be heavy
- **Mitigation**: Frontload easy coursework, optimize schedule
- **Contingency**: Reduce OSCP lab hours during midterms/finals, compensate later

**Burnout Risk: MODERATE**
- **Risk**: 12 months of intense studying
- **Mitigation**: Schedule rest weeks, maintain work-life balance
- **Contingency**: Build buffer time between certifications

**Exam Failure Risk**
- **Risk**: OSCP has ~40-50% first-time pass rate
