## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Skipping PWK modules** - They teach methodology you need
❌ **Rushing through lab machines** - Speed comes naturally, focus on understanding
❌ **Not documenting as you go** - Writeups take forever if left to end
❌ **Ignoring buffer overflow** - It's 25% of exam, master it early
❌ **Not doing mock exams** - Exam day shock is real, practice 24-hour endurance
❌ **Poor sleep during labs** - Tired brain learns nothing, sleep 8 hours
❌ **Burning out before exam** - Pace yourself, you have 3.5 months
❌ **Waiting too long to schedule exam** - Pick date 6 weeks out, creates deadline pressure

✅ **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Complete PWK before hard labs (foundation matters)
- ✅ Document every machine (builds portfolio + memory)
- ✅ Do 2+ mock exams (exam conditions are shocking)
- ✅ Master buffer overflow first (it's the gatekeep)
- ✅ Maintain sleep schedule (8 hours, always)
- ✅ Take notes on every machine (patterns emerge)
- ✅ Build your checklists (enumeration, PE, lateral move)
- ✅ Practice report writing (turn in quality documentation)

## Real Talk

**OSCP is hard.**

Not "I studied and got OSCP is hard."

It's "I destroyed 70 machines and still felt unprepared for that exam" hard.

**But you'll be ready because:**
1. You completed PNPT (you know methodology)
2. You'll have 100+ machines experience (solid foundation)
3. You'll do 2+ mock exams (exam conditions aren't a shock)
4. You have discipline (BUD/S mentality)
5. You'll have 3.5 months (plenty of time)

**Most people who fail OSCP:**
- ❌ Don't have PNPT foundation (they do, you do)
- ❌ Rush through labs (you won't, you're methodical)
- ❌ Don't do mock exams (you will)
- ❌ Give up when frustrated (you won't, you've got BUD/S mindset)
