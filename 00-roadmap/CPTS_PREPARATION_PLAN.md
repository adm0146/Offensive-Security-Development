---

## Progression: After PNPT

Once you pass PNPT (May 15):
1. **Rest & Recovery** - 1-2 weeks to recover
2. **OSCP Prep** - Start May 20 (600-700 hours)
3. **Use PNPT skills** - Methodology + reporting applies to OSCP
4. **Confidence boost** - You'll know you can handle practical exams

**How PNPT skills transfer to OSCP:**
- Enumeration methodology (critical for both)
- Exploitation chains (PNPT teaches this well)
- Time management (PNPT's 5 days trains for OSCP's 24 hours)
- Report writing (OSCP requires detailed documentation)
- Post-exploitation (PNPT emphasizes this more than courses)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Spending too long on one machine** - Move on, come back later
❌ **Ignoring documentation** - Notes from reconnaissance are gold
❌ **Neglecting report quality** - Professional presentation matters
❌ **Skipping post-exploitation** - Easy points if you document properly
❌ **Not managing time** - Track hours, prioritize high-value targets
❌ **Weak OPSEC** - Don't get detected or cause damage

✅ **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Take detailed notes during enumeration
- ✅ Screenshot EVERYTHING (proof of exploitation)
- ✅ Focus on high-value targets first
- ✅ Document your methodology as you go
- ✅ Plan report writing while testing
- ✅ Get rest between days
