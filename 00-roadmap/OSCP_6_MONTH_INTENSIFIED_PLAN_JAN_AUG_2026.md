## 💪 MAINTAINING MOMENTUM

### Spring Semester (Jan-May) Tips
- **Study blocks are NON-NEGOTIABLE** - Schedule OSCP before courses, not after
- **Weekends are OSCP intensive** - Saturday mornings are your biggest time investment
- **Quality over quantity** - 15 focused hours beats 20 distracted hours
- **Progress tracking** - Log each machine, each technique, each "aha moment"
- **Community engagement** - Talk to other OSCP seekers (TryHackMe, Reddit forums)

### Summer Intensive Tips
- **Treat it like a job** - 9-5 OSCP study schedule (10 AM office hour mentality)
- **Deep work sessions** - 4-hour uninterrupted blocks with minimal breaks
- **Writeup while fresh** - Finish machine, immediately document while you remember
- **Rest strategically** - One full day off per week (non-negotiable)
- **Nutrition matters** - Fuel your brain, don't survive on coffee

### Pre-Exam Tips
- **Exam simulation is critical** - Full 24-hour practice run at least once
- **Tool mastery** - Know Metasploit AND manual exploitation equally
- **Documentation practice** - Time yourself writing 3-4 machine writeups
- **Sleep schedule** - Sync to exam time zone/schedule 1-2 weeks before

## 📝 INTEGRATION WITH SPRING 2026 COURSEWORK

**Courses (Jan 7 - May 1):**
- COMP 5830, COMP 5120, COMP 4200 (Formal Languages - **priority**), MATH 2660, COMP 5700
- Total: ~30-35 hours/week

**OSCP Addition:**
- Jan-May: +15 hours/week during Phases 1-4
- **Total weekly commitment: 45-50 hours/week**
- Doable with:
  - 5 AM gym start (health = energy)
  - Minimal social life (worth it for certification)
  - Weekend OSCP blocks
  - Holiday breaks extended OSCP time

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. ✅ Early morning gym (5-6 AM) keeps energy high
2. ✅ Spring schedule front-loads OSCP (Phases 1-4: 290 hours)
3. ✅ Summer allows deferred, intensive focus (650 hours)
4. ✅ Formal Languages recovery gets Friday attention (not sacrificed)
5. ✅ Courses get weekday daytime; OSCP gets early morning + evenings + weekends

---

## 🚀 YOU CAN DO THIS

**You're committing to:**
- 940 hours of strategic study
- 6-month focused dedication
- Simultaneous 15-credit coursework (Jan-May)
- Formal Languages recovery priority
- Personal health (gym 5x/week)

**This is ambitious but achievable.** The key is consistent execution, especially during spring when you're juggling courses. Your schedule front-loads the foundation (Phases 1-2) during spring when you have a bit more breathing room, then ramps up aggressively in summer when academic pressure releases.

**Timeline aligns perfectly:**
- Summer break (May 5 - Aug 15) gives you 100+ full-time study days
- This allows Phases 5-7 to happen without competing deadlines
- You'll take the exam mid-August with maximum preparation

**Now go crush it.** 💪
