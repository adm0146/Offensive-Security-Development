## Course Load (Updated)

| Course | Meeting Times | Credits | Instructor | Location | Grade Target |
|--------|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| COMP 5830 | Distance Learning | 3.0 | Mulder, Samuel | Online | A |
| COMP 5700 | Distance Learning | 3.0 | Rahman, Akond | Online | A |
| COMP 4200 | Mon/Wed/Fri 2:00-2:50 PM | 3.0 | Chen, Sanchuan | BKENG 2133 | A- |
| COMP 5120 | Mon/Wed/Fri 12:00-12:50 PM | 3.0 | Jariwala, Abhishek | SHLBY 2101 | B+ |
| ~~MATH 2660~~ | ~~Tue/Thu 12:30-1:45 PM~~ | ~~3.0~~ | ~~Oeding, Luke~~ | ~~ACLC 108~~ | **DROPPED** |

**Total Credits:** 12.0 (down from 15.0)

**Rationale:** Linear Algebra (MATH 2660) dropped to free up ~3-4 hours per week for focused CPTS preparation. CPTS exam is April 1-10 - needs 400 hours total prep. This strategic move allows maximum focus on certification coursework.

## Priority Hierarchy (Updated Jan 14, 2026)

### Tier 1 - CRITICAL (Career-making)
1. **CPTS Preparation** - Feb 1 - April 10 (400 hours) → Lab-based exam April 1-10
2. **Cybersecurity Core Classes** - COMP 5830, COMP 5700, COMP 4200 (A grades required)

### Tier 2 - Important (Foundation)
3. **COMP 5120** - B+ is acceptable
4. **OSCP Foundation Work** - Lighter during PNPT focus (Jan-May integration)

### Tier 3 - Maintenance
5. Health, sleep, sanity, personal time

## CPTS Focus During Spring Semester

### February 1 - April 10: CPTS Preparation (400 hours)

**Available Time Allocation:**
- **7:00 AM - 9:00 AM:** CPTS labs (2 hours daily) = 10 hours/week
- **9:00 AM - 11:30 AM:** CPTS curriculum (2.5 hours daily) = 12.5 hours/week
- **3:50 PM - 5:00 PM:** CPTS labs (1 hour daily) = 5 hours/week
- **6:00 PM - 8:00 PM:** CPTS intensive lab work (2 hours daily) = 10 hours/week
- **Weekend:** Extra 2.5 hours/week as needed

**Total Available:** ~40 hours/week for CPTS work
**Required:** 40 hours/week average (400 hours ÷ 10 weeks)
**Status:** ✅ Perfect match - exactly on target

## Class Performance Targets

| Class | Type | Credits | Target | Strategy |
|-------|------|---------|--------|----------|
| COMP 5830 | Online (Cybersec) | 3.0 | A | Watch all videos, complete all assignments early |
| COMP 5700 | Online (Secure Soft) | 3.0 | A | Start projects week 1, consistent effort |
| COMP 4200 | In-person (FL) | 3.0 | A- | Attend all classes, office hours as needed |
| COMP 5120 | In-person | 3.0 | B+ | Minimum viable effort, delegation OK |
| MATH 2660 | ~~In-person~~ | ~~3.0~~ | ~~B+~~ | **DROPPED** |

**Cybersecurity Core (A grades):** These are career-critical - allocate first
**Supporting Course (B+):** COMP 5120 can take 2nd priority
**Dropped:** Linear Algebra freed up 3-4 hours/week

---

## Time Management Strategy

### Class Hours (Locked)
- Mon/Wed/Fri: 1:00 PM - 3:50 PM (classes) = 2 hrs daily × 3 = 6 hrs/week
- Total: 6 hours/week of locked class time
- Result: 9 hours/week free time (vs 13.5 without MATH 2660)

### Study Hours (Flexible)
- **PNPT Focus:** 40-50 hours/week available (only need 7.7)
- **Online Classes:** 5-8 hours/week (COMP 5830, 5700)
- **Gym:** 5 hours/week (5 AM slot)
- **Sleep:** 56 hours/week (8 hours/night minimum)
- **Meals/Transition:** 10 hours/week

### Buffer & Flexibility
- Extra 20+ hours/week available for:
  - Exam prep surges
  - Class project overload
  - OSCP foundation work
  - Recovery/health

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk: PNPT Exam in May while finals happening
**Mitigation:** PNPT exam IS the final week - classes end May 1, exam May 30

### Risk: Online courses sneak up on you
**Mitigation:** Start COMP 5830, 5700 work week 1 (not last week)

### Risk: In-person classes hard to skip
**Mitigation:** They're locked anyway (COMP 5120, COMP 4200) - use them as breaks

### Risk: PNPT needs 400 hours but feels overwhelming
**Mitigation:** You have 40-50 hours/week available - it's distributed, not cramped

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **PNPT:** Complete course, pass practical exam (May 30)
✅ **COMP 5830:** A grade
✅ **COMP 5700:** A grade  
✅ **COMP 4200:** A- minimum
✅ **COMP 5120:** B+ minimum
✅ **Health:** 5 AM gym 3-4x/week, 8+ hours sleep
✅ **OSCP:** Light foundation work (Jan-May), prepare for intensive May 20 start

## Strategic Notes

**Why Drop Linear Algebra?**
- MATH 2660 = 3 credits (Tue/Thu 12:30-1:45 PM)
- That's 3-4 hours/week of preparation
- PNPT exam is fixed May 30 - no flexibility
- Linear algebra is NOT required for PNPT/OSCP
- Better to have one A grade vs rushed B+ grade
- PNPT is a **practical exam** - needs hands-on lab time, not math

**Certification Priority:**
1. PNPT (May 30) - Next immediate goal
2. OSCP (Sept 26) - Big goal for summer  
3. Cybersecurity classes (A grades) - Career credentials
4. Linear algebra (optional) - Can take anytime or skip

**This is the right call.** You're being strategic about time allocation, not lazy.
