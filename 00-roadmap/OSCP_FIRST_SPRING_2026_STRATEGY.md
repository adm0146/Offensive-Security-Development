# OSCP-FIRST STRATEGY: SPRING 2026
**Certified by August 1, 2026 | A Grades in Cybersecurity | Sustainable Schedule**

---

## 🎯 YOUR REAL GOAL

**Get OSCP certified and land a penetration testing job.**

Everything else is secondary. This changes how you study, what grades matter, and how you spend your time.

---

## 📋 GRADE PRIORITIES (BE REAL ABOUT THIS)

### MUST GET A's (Career-Critical)
- **COMP 5830** (Cybersecurity Threats): A
- **COMP 5700** (Secure Software): A  
- **COMP 4200** (Formal Languages): A- minimum

Why? These go on your resume. Employers see "Cybersecurity" in the title and pay attention.

### Nice to Have A's (Not Critical)
- **COMP 5120** (Database Systems): B+ is fine
- **MATH 2660** (Linear Algebra): B+ is fine

Why? Generic CS courses. Everyone has them. They don't matter for cybersecurity jobs.

## ⏰ THE WEEKLY SCHEDULE (OSCP-FIRST)

### Your Non-Negotiable Time Blocks

**OSCP (15-20 hours/week):**
- Monday 7-9 AM: 2 hours
- Tuesday 7-9 AM + 3-5 PM: 4 hours
- Wednesday 7-9 AM + 4-6 PM: 4 hours
- Thursday 7-9 AM + 4-6 PM: 4 hours
- Friday 7-9 AM: 2 hours
- Saturday 8 AM-12 PM: 4 hours
- Sunday 9-10 AM: 1 hour
- **Total: 21 hours/week** ← This happens, no exceptions

**Cybersecurity Classes (4-6 hours/week):**
- COMP 5830: Tuesday/Thursday online work (1-2 hrs/week)
- COMP 5700: Wednesday/Thursday projects (2-3 hrs/week)
- Both are online and manageable if you stay on top
- **You CAN get A's in both with 4-6 hours/week if you don't procrastinate**

**Formal Languages Recovery (8-10 hours/week):**
- Monday-Friday before class: 1-1.5 hrs/day = 5-7.5 hrs
- Weekend: 2-3 hrs Sunday = 2-3 hrs
- **Total: 8-10 hours/week**
- Target: A- minimum (recovery from 22.5/70)

**Other Courses (8-10 hours/week):**
- Database Systems: 4-5 hrs/week
- Math: 3-5 hrs/week
- These get whatever energy is left
- B+ is acceptable; don't stress

**Total Weekly Commitment: ~40-45 hours/week** ✓ Sustainable

## 🚀 SPRING SEMESTER SURVIVAL GUIDE

### Weeks 1-4 (January 6 - February 2) — Phase 1 Ramp Up
- OSCP Phase 1 foundation building
- Get into routine (gym, early mornings, schedule)
- Formal Languages recovery in full swing
- Don't let online courses slip yet
- **Focus:** Establish patterns, no crises

### Weeks 5-7 (February 3 - February 24) — Midterms Crunch
- OSCP Phase 2 starts (PWK content)
- Formal Languages midterm exam likely
- Math midterm likely
- Database might have first project
- **Strategy:** Front-load OSCP work early in week, save midterm study for Wed/Thu/Fri
- **Goal:** Pass Formal Languages midterm with 50+/70 (your recovery target)

### Weeks 8-9 (February 24 - March 9) — Post-Midterm Reset
- Recover from midterm intensity
- OSCP Phase 2 continues
- Reset routines if they slipped
- Cybersecurity classes due for assignments
- **Strategy:** Easy week—catch up on sleep, reset schedule

### Weeks 10-11 (March 10-24) — Spring Break (YOU GET A REST WEEK!)
- March 9-13 is Spring Break
- **Use this strategically:**
  - First 3 days: catch up on sleep, rest
  - Next 2 days: get ahead on assignments
  - You're NOT studying OSCP hard this week (lighter: 5-7 hrs)
- **By week 11, all coursework should be in good shape**

### Weeks 12-15 (March 24 - May 1) — Home Stretch
- OSCP Phase 3-4 (lab exploitation)
- Final projects for all classes
- Final exams approaching
- Cybersecurity classes final assignments
- **Strategy:** You've done the work. Don't panic. Maintain schedule.
- **Goal:** All classes wrapped by May 1, OSCP on track for 290 spring hours

## 💪 HOW TO MAINTAIN OSCP FOCUS

### Rule #1: OSCP Hours Are Sacred
- You don't skip 7-9 AM OSCP blocks for homework
- You don't postpone Saturday OSCP for studying math
- If a class needs emergency time, it comes from Database/Math, NOT OSCP
- OSCP is the job interview. Classes are the paper.

### Rule #2: Cybersecurity Classes Get Premium Effort
- These ARE related to OSCP
- What you learn in COMP 5700 applies to OSCP writeups
- What you learn in COMP 5830 applies to OSCP enumeration
- These are NOT generic classes—they're building your career foundation
- **You can knock out A's here with disciplined work**

### Rule #3: Other Classes Are Minimum Viable
- Database Systems: Turn in assignments, don't stress about perfection
- Math: Attend class, do homework, don't cram for exams
- B+ is acceptable; A would be great but don't sacrifice OSCP for it
- You're not being a bad student—you're prioritizing

### Rule #4: Front-Load Work
- Week you have OSCP exam simulation (4-5 hour machine): lighter homework that week
- Week you have Database project due: get 80% done week 1, 20% week 2
- Week you have Math exam: light OSCP work (8-10 hrs instead of 20)
- **Plan ahead so nothing crashes into each other**

## 🏆 EXPECTED OUTCOMES (REALISTIC)

### By May 1 (End of Spring Semester)
- **OSCP:** Phase 1-2 complete (290 hours logged)
- **COMP 5830:** A (easy online course)
- **COMP 5700:** A (easy online course + skills applied)
- **COMP 4200:** A- (recovered from 22.5/70 initial fail)
- **COMP 5120:** B+ to A- (solid, maybe not A)
- **MATH 2660:** B+ to A- (solid, maybe not A)
- **GPA:** 3.6-3.8 (excellent for cybersecurity jobs)
- **Health:** Still gym 5x/week, reasonably sane

### By August 1 (OSCP Exam)
- **OSCP:** Certified (70+/100, target 85+/100)
- **Resume:** OSCP-certified, cybersecurity classes aced
- **Skills:** Deep hands-on hacking foundation
- **Ready for:** Entry-level pen testing/security job
- **Next step:** Apply to positions, interview with OSCP + relevant classes

## ⚠️ RED FLAGS TO WATCH

**If this happens, adjust immediately:**

1. **OSCP hours slip below 12/week for 2 weeks**
   → You're getting off track. Reset immediately. No excuses.

2. **Cybersecurity classes start dropping below assignments**
   → Cut Database/Math time, not these.

3. **You're averaging under 6 hours sleep 3+ nights/week**
   → You're unsustainable. Reduce something. Better B+ in Math than burnout.

4. **OSCP labs feel hopeless (can't solve anything)**
   → Normal. Join TryHackMe, do easier machines, build confidence. Don't quit.

5. **All 5 classes need major work same week**
   → Front-load earlier weeks. Use weekends for catch-up. It's temporary.

6. **Gym stops happening**
   → That's the stress management. Don't cut it. If you cut gym, cut Database/Math instead.

## 🎓 WHAT HIRING MANAGERS WILL SEE

**Your Resume (May 2026):**
```
CERTIFICATIONS:
- OSCP Certified (Offensive Security)

RELEVANT COURSEWORK:
- Cybersecurity Threats & Countermeasures (A)
- Secure Software Process (A)
- Formal Languages (A-)

GPA: 3.6+
```

**What They Think:**
"This person is serious about cybersecurity. They have OSCP (the real deal), they aced the security courses (skills-based), and they recovered from a setback (resilient). GPA is solid. Hire for interview."

**What They DON'T Think:**
"Hmm, they got a B+ in Database Systems instead of an A. Disqualified."

Nobody cares about your Database grade. They care about OSCP.

---

## 🔥 YOUR MANTRA

**"OSCP certified by August 1. Cybersecurity A's. Everything else is secondary."**

Repeat this when you're tired. Repeat this when Database homework feels overwhelming. Repeat this when you want to skip the 7 AM OSCP block.

This is a 6-month sprint to a real career in cybersecurity. Not all semesters are the same. This one has a goal.

---

## 📅 COMMITMENT CHECK

Before you fully commit to this, answer honestly:

1. **Can you do 15-20 OSCP hours/week for 5 months?** (Even when tired)
2. **Will you prioritize OSCP over Database/Math?** (When conflicts happen)
3. **Can you maintain gym 5x/week?** (For energy, not perfection)
4. **Are you OK with B+ in non-cybersecurity classes?** (If needed)
5. **Do you understand OSCP certification matters more than GPA?** (For your goals)

If you answered yes to all 5: You're ready. Go crush this.

If you answered no to any: Adjust the plan. Talk to me. We'll recalibrate.

---

**You've got this. Six months. OSCP certified. Cybersecurity professional. Let's go.** 💪
