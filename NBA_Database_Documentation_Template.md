## Notes on Documentation Style
- Be specific about relationships - don't just say 'connects to team table', say '[table_name].[column_name] connects to [other_table].[column_name]'
- For name/identifier columns, give examples of actual values when helpful
- Explain what data/stat columns measure or represent
- Think about how you would USE these tables in queries - that will help you identify important columns
