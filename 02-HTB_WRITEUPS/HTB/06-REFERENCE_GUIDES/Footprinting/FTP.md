# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

> One of the oldest protocols on the internet - runs at application layer alongside HTTP and POP.

## How FTP Works

### Two-Channel Architecture

| Channel | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Control** | TCP 21 | Commands & status codes |
| **Data** | TCP 20 | File transfers |

**Connection Flow:**
1. Client connects to server on **port 21** (control channel)
2. Client sends commands, server returns status codes
3. Data channel established on **port 20** for actual transfers
4. Protocol monitors for errors - can resume broken transfers

---

## Active vs Passive FTP

### Active FTP
```
Client → Server (port 21): "Connect to my port XXXX for data"
Server → Client (port XXXX): Attempts connection
```
**Problem:** If client has firewall, server can't connect back (external connections blocked)

### Passive FTP
```
Client → Server (port 21): "I need passive mode"
Server → Client: "Connect to my port YYYY for data"
Client → Server (port YYYY): Establishes data channel
```
**Solution:** Client initiates ALL connections - firewall doesn't block outbound

---

## FTP Commands & Status Codes

Common operations:
- Upload/download files
- Create/delete directories
- Delete files

Server responds with status codes:
- **1xx** - Positive preliminary
- **2xx** - Positive completion
- **3xx** - Positive intermediate
- **4xx** - Transient negative
- **5xx** - Permanent negative

## Authentication

### Standard FTP
- Requires credentials (username/password)
- **Clear-text protocol** - can be sniffed on network

### Anonymous FTP
- No password required
- Server allows public access
- Usually restricted options (security risk)
- Common anonymous creds: `anonymous:anonymous` or `anonymous:email@address`

---

## Security Considerations

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Clear-text** | Credentials visible if sniffed |
| **Anonymous access** | Potential data exposure |
| **No encryption** | All data transmitted in plain text |

**Secure alternatives:** SFTP (SSH), FTPS (FTP over TLS)

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Default ports
Control: TCP 21
Data: TCP 20 (active) / random high port (passive)

# Common anonymous creds
anonymous:anonymous
anonymous:guest
ftp:ftp
```

---

## TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

> Simpler than FTP - no authentication, uses UDP instead of TCP.

### FTP vs TFTP

| Feature | FTP | TFTP |
|---------|-----|------|
| Protocol | TCP | UDP |
| Authentication | Yes | No |
| Directory listing | Yes | No |
| Security | Basic | None |
| Use case | General transfers | Local/protected networks only |

### TFTP Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `connect` | Set remote host and port for transfers |
| `get` | Download file(s) from remote to local |
| `put` | Upload file(s) from local to remote |
| `quit` | Exit TFTP |
| `status` | Show current status (mode, connection, timeout) |
| `verbose` | Toggle verbose mode on/off |

**Key limitation:** No directory listing functionality

---

## vsFTPd Configuration (Linux)

Default config: `/etc/vsftpd.conf`

```bash
# Install
sudo apt install vsftpd

# View active settings (exclude comments)
cat /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v "#"
```
> `grep -v "#"` removes all comment lines from the config file so you only see active settings. This is faster than reading through the full config. Use the same trick on any config file to filter out noise.

### Key Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `listen=NO` | Run from inetd or standalone daemon |
| `listen_ipv6=YES` | Listen on IPv6 |
| `anonymous_enable=NO` | Enable anonymous access |
| `local_enable=YES` | Allow local users to login |
| `dirmessage_enable=YES` | Display directory messages |
| `use_localtime=YES` | Use local time |
| `xferlog_enable=YES` | Log uploads/downloads |
| `connect_from_port_20=YES` | Connect from port 20 |
| `secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty` | Empty directory for chroot |
| `pam_service_name=vsftpd` | PAM service name |
| `ssl_enable=NO` | Enable SSL connections |

### SSL Certificate Settings
```
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
```

### Deny User Access

File: `/etc/ftpusers` - users listed here are **blocked** from FTP

```bash
cat /etc/ftpusers
# Example output:
guest
john
kevin
```
> `/etc/ftpusers` is a deny list — users in this file cannot log in via FTP even if their credentials are valid. Check this file during post-exploitation to understand which accounts are restricted.

Users in this file cannot login even if they exist on the system.

---

## Dangerous Settings (Pentester's Focus)

### Anonymous Access Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `anonymous_enable=YES` | Allow anonymous login |
| `anon_upload_enable=YES` | Allow anonymous file uploads |
| `anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES` | Allow anonymous to create directories |
| `no_anon_password=YES` | Don't ask anonymous for password |
| `anon_root=/home/username/ftp` | Anonymous root directory |
| `write_enable=YES` | Allow STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, SITE commands |

### Additional Dangerous Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dirmessage_enable=YES` | Show message when entering directories |
| `chown_uploads=YES` | Change ownership of anonymous uploads |
| `chown_username=username` | User given ownership of anonymous uploads |
| `local_enable=YES` | Enable local user login |
| `chroot_local_user=YES` | Jail local users to home directory |
| `chroot_list_enable=YES` | Use list for chroot users |
| `hide_ids=YES` | Display all UID/GID as "ftp" (hides real users) |
| `ls_recurse_enable=YES` | Allow recursive directory listing |

## FTP Enumeration

### Connect & Login
```bash
ftp 10.129.14.136
# Response code 220 = banner (often shows version!)
# Login as: anonymous
```
> Connect to the FTP server and log in as `anonymous`. The 220 banner often reveals the server software and version — note it for CVE research. Replace `10.129.14.136` with your target IP.

### Useful FTP Commands
```bash
ftp> status          # Show connection settings
ftp> debug           # Enable debug mode (debug=1)
ftp> trace           # Enable packet tracing
ftp> ls              # List directory
ftp> ls -R           # Recursive listing (if ls_recurse_enable=YES)
```
> Run these interactively after connecting. `debug` and `trace` show the raw protocol exchange — useful when something isn't working. `ls -R` recursively lists all directories in one command, giving you the full file tree.

### What to Look For
- **Banner** - May reveal version info
- **Response code 220** - Connection successful
- **Response code 230** - Login successful
- **File listings** - Sensitive docs, configs, credentials
- **UID/GID info** - If not hidden, reveals usernames for brute-force

### Example Anonymous Login
```
Connected to 10.129.14.136.
220 "Welcome to the HTB Academy vsFTP service."
Name: anonymous
230 Login successful.
```

### Debug/Trace Output
```bash
ftp> debug
Debugging on (debug=1).

ftp> trace
Packet tracing on.

ftp> ls
---> PORT 10,10,14,4,188,195
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
---> LIST
150 Here comes the directory listing.
```

### hide_ids=YES Effect
```
# Without hide_ids - reveals real users:
-rw-rw-r--    1 1002     1002      8138592 Sep 14 16:54 file.pptx

# With hide_ids - obscures users:
-rw-rw-r--    1 ftp      ftp       8138592 Sep 14 16:54 file.pptx
```

### Recursive Listing (ls_recurse_enable=YES)
```bash
ftp> ls -R
# Shows ALL visible content in one command
# Great for mapping directory structure quickly
```

---

## Attack Vectors

| Vector | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Anonymous access** | List/download sensitive files without creds |
| **File upload + LFI** | Upload malicious file, trigger via LFI for RCE |
| **FTP log poisoning** | Inject commands into logs → RCE |
| **Username enumeration** | If hide_ids=NO, harvest usernames for brute-force |
| **Banner grabbing** | Version info for known exploits |

**Note:** Modern infrastructure uses fail2ban to block brute-force attempts.

---

## File Operations

### Download Single File
```bash
ftp> get Important\ Notes.txt
# Escapes spaces in filename
# File saved to current local directory
```
> Use `get` inside the FTP session to download a file. Backslash-escape spaces in filenames. The file lands in whichever directory you were in when you launched `ftp`.

### Download ALL Files (wget)
```bash
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136

# Creates directory named after IP
# Downloads entire FTP structure
# ⚠️ May trigger alarms - unusual behavior
```
> `-m` mirrors the entire FTP directory tree recursively. `--no-passive` forces active mode, which works better with some servers. The downloaded files are placed in a folder named after the target IP. Use this to grab everything at once when anonymous access is allowed. Replace the IP with your target.

**Result:**
```
tree .
└── 10.129.14.136
    ├── Calendar.pptx
    ├── Clients
    │   └── Inlanefreight
    │       ├── appointments.xlsx
    │       └── contract.docx
    ├── Documents
    └── Important Notes.txt
```

### Upload Files
```bash
# Create local file
touch testupload.txt

# Upload via FTP
ftp> put testupload.txt
226 Transfer complete.
```
> `put` uploads a file from your local machine to the FTP server. If anonymous uploads are allowed and the FTP root syncs to a web directory, you can upload a web shell and trigger it via HTTP.

**Why uploads matter:** If FTP syncs to webserver → upload malicious file → LFI/RCE

---

## Nmap FTP Enumeration

### Update NSE Scripts
```bash
sudo nmap --script-updatedb
```
> Updates Nmap's local database of Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts. Run this after installing new scripts so Nmap can find them by name.

### Find FTP Scripts
```bash
find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts

# Key scripts:
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-anon.nse      # Anonymous access check
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-syst.nse      # Server status/version
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-brute.nse     # Brute force
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-bounce.nse    # Bounce attack check
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.nse  # Known backdoor
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-proftpd-backdoor.nse # Known backdoor
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-vuln-cve2010-4221.nse
```
> `find` with `-name ftp*` locates all FTP-related NSE scripts. `2>/dev/null` suppresses permission errors. The key script to always run is `ftp-anon` — it checks for anonymous login automatically.

### Standard FTP Scan
```bash
sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.14.136
```
> Runs version detection (`-sV`), default scripts (`-sC`), and OS/traceroute (`-A`) against FTP port 21. The default scripts include `ftp-anon`, so you automatically get an anonymous login check. Replace `10.129.14.136` with your target IP.

**Example Output:**
```
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
| -rwxrwxrwx    1 ftp  ftp  8138592 Calendar.pptx [NSE: writeable]
| drwxrwxrwx    4 ftp  ftp     4096 Clients [NSE: writeable]
|_-rwxrwxrwx    1 ftp  ftp       41 Important Notes.txt [NSE: writeable]
| ftp-syst: 
|   STAT: 
|      Connected to 10.10.14.4
|      vsFTPd 3.0.3 - secure, fast, stable
```

**Key findings from scan:**
- Anonymous login allowed ✓
- Files are writeable ✓
- Version info: vsFTPd 3.0.3

### Script Trace (Debug)
```bash
sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.14.136 --script-trace
# Shows exact commands sent/received at network level
```
> `--script-trace` prints every NSE command and server response at the network level. Use it when a script produces unexpected results — you can see exactly what was sent and what came back. Replace `10.129.14.136` with your target IP.

---

## Alternative Connection Methods

### Netcat
```bash
nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
```
> Grabs the raw FTP banner without opening a full FTP session. Useful for quick version identification when you just need the banner. Replace `10.129.14.136` with your target IP.

### Telnet
```bash
telnet 10.129.14.136 21
```
> Another raw banner grab method. Telnet lets you type FTP commands manually line by line. Useful when the standard `ftp` client is unavailable.

### OpenSSL (TLS/SSL FTP)
```bash
openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp
```
> `-starttls ftp` upgrades a plain FTP connection to TLS. This reveals the SSL certificate, which often contains the hostname, organization name, and admin email — valuable recon data. Replace `10.129.14.136` with your target IP.

**Why OpenSSL matters:** Shows SSL certificate with:
- Hostname (e.g., `master.inlanefreight.htb`)
- Email (e.g., `admin@inlanefreight.htb`)
- Organization info
- Location info

**Example Certificate Info:**
```
depth=0 C = US, ST = California, L = Sacramento, 
O = Inlanefreight, OU = Dev, 
CN = master.inlanefreight.htb, 
emailAddress = admin@inlanefreight.htb
```
