## Notes & Observations

### Week-by-Week Learnings
**Week 1 (Jan 22-28):**
- ✅ Manual website inspection > automated scanning (Simple Backup plugin found in blog post, not by tools)
- ✅ Plugin discovery methodology (search website, look for announcements, identify versions)
- ✅ SearchSploit before Metasploit (understand vulnerability before loading exploit)
- ✅ Scanner modules valuable for file read vulnerabilities (don't always need RCE)
- ✅ Two-stage exploitation reduces risk (verify on /etc/passwd before extracting /flag.txt)
- ✅ Service version ≠ vulnerability (Apache 2.4.41 wasn't the target, WordPress 5.6.1 was)
- ✅ Metasploit framework navigation (search, use, set, show options, run)
- ✅ Strategic pivoting (switched from Elementor → GiveWP → Simple Backup when exploits didn't work)

**Week 2-3:**
- 

**Week 4-5:**

## How to Use This Integration

**Daily Workflow:**
1. Check `HTB_JUNIOR_PENTESTER_PROGRESS.md` for today's learning module
2. Complete the module during 7-9 AM study block
3. Check here (`CPTS_PROGRESS.md`) to see if you're ready for the next box difficulty
4. If ready, attempt next-level machine (afternoon/evening lab work)
5. Document box writeup in corresponding difficulty folder (01-EASY/, 02-MEDIUM/, etc.)
6. Update both progress files

**Weekly Sync:**
- Monday: Review learning path progress for the week
- Check if you're unlocking the next machine difficulty level
- Adjust box selection based on what you've learned
- Ensure learning modules are feeding directly into machine selection

**Strategic Checkpoint (Feb 1):**
- Complete HTB Junior Pentester 100% before starting CPTS
- This IS the required foundation; don't skip modules to get to machines faster
- Quality foundation = faster machine completion later
