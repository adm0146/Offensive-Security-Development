ETCD THREAT MODELING PROMPT

You are a security expert. Identify 5 distinct threat models for etcd (distributed key-value store used in Kubernetes).

For each threat, provide:
1. Threat Description
2. Threat Actor
3. Preconditions
4. Impact
5. Post-Conditions
6. Severity Rank (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

Use chain-of-thought reasoning. Format clearly with headers for each threat.

Context: etcd stores sensitive data (credentials, certificates, cluster state), uses HTTP/gRPC communication, has auth mechanisms.

Generate 5 realistic, technically feasible threats across different attack categories.
